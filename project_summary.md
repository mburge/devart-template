## Description

According to neurologist Semir Zeki, artists have preferred modes of cognition that direct production. What can we learn from an obsession with observing faces on a train commute? This daily d√©rive of morphologies  - bracketing color or expressions - sparked our project. 

An interactive installation, Face Cloud presents an infinite field of haunting, unique, artificial faces that are  generated from a hidden research database of scanned real faces. Users may scan their own faces to be added to that database - the vault. The diversity, nuance and complexity of the Face Cloud that draws from it visibly increases with each entry. 

Spanning 60 dimensions, the cloud is produced by subverting standard face recognition algorithms.

This project reverses face detection and recognition narratives. Instead of singling out, it joins. By suggesting ways of parsing and projecting the visible world, it is epistemic.
