The installation consists of four elements:

1. Three or possibly more terminals at which users can snap and upload
their own faces into the face cloud and modify them with the 60
sliders.

2. A large projection that cycles through the faces on the terminals
as they are being modified. In the absence of interaction, it randomly
generates new faces from face cloud.

3. A wireless laser printer. From the terminal, users can send any
number of faces they select to the printer, and take home the output.


4. Face cloud, getting diversified.
