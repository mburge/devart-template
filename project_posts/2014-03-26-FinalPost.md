Over the course of this competition, we have explored aspects of the face cloud. Synthetic face, the interface that allows users to manipulate their own and any number of random faces generated in face cloud, has risen to the top.

The installation consists of four elements:

1. Three or possibly more terminals at which users can snap and upload their own faces into the face cloud and modify them with the 60 sliders.   
2. A large projection that cycles through the faces on the terminals as they are being modified. In the absence of interaction, it randomly generates new faces from face cloud.   
3. A wireless laser printer. From the terminal, users can send any number of faces they select to the printer, and take home the output.   
4. Face cloud, getting diversified.   

 
We think that this installation has a rich didactic potential, much of which we have previously addressed: Face recognition, dimensionality, principal component analysis are just some aspects.   

The faces themselves are eerily haunting. They hover on a border between real and unreal that is equally disconcerting and fascinating.   

With this, Face Cloud and Synthetic face could be equally at home in a science or math museum as in an art and media context.
