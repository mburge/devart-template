Final Post   

The Face Cloud is a rich and dense space, full of potential.   

1. It contains an infinite number of distinct faces. This aspect of the Face Cloud creates visually stunning art work.   

2. It contains your face, and other similar faces nearby. This aspect prompts of to think of Face Recognition algorithms and suggests means to subvert surveillance technologies.   

3. It is an visual and intuitive way to gain an understanding of linear algebra concepts like Eigen Vectors and Principal Component Analysis. This aspect enourages us to think of STEAM concepts and educational venues.   

Over the course of this project we have explored all of these aspects, but are drawn to the final one: using the visualizations we have created to explore mathematical concepts.   


Installation overview:   

You, the visitor, approach the kiosk. Your face is uploaded into the Face cloud. When we upload your face, what we are doing is a subspace projection into 60 dimensional face space. We can look at this projected face. Sometimes it is quite recognizable, other times less so. It seems blurry and slightly distorted because 60 dimensions is not enough to capture all the detail. But it is enough for many analyses.   

Sample real and projected faces:

Once your face is in the face space, a special dashboard shows the coordinates of your face in 60 dimensional space, and allows you to manipulate these coordinates via simple sliders.

The relationship between your projected face, the average face and the anti-face becomes clear.

We use fractals to capture higher dimensions:
