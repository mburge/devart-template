The 'Curse of Dimensionality' refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces. (Wikipedia) Visualizing higher dimensional spaces is a problem that recurs frequently in scientific and mathematic didactic settings and our explorations here with the Face Cloud have wider application in those domains.

It often seems easiest to start with the average face:

Note how all the coordinates are 0. This face resides exactly in the middle of the face cloud.   

The average face is androgynous. It is not race-neutral because our original sample set (a commonly used research data set from academia) was biased towards caucasian faces. This is a problem we hope to fix in the future as we collect more faces. Research data sets are not always very diverse. 

What if we move the top slider to the right? Try it yourself here: [Average Face](http://facefield.org/SynthFace.aspx?c0=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&c5=0&c6=0&c7=0&c8=0&c9=0&c10=0&c11=0&c12=0&c13=0&c14=0&c15=0&c16=0&c17=0&c18=0&c19=0&c20=0&c21=0&c22=0&c23=0&c24=0&c25=0&c26=0&c27=0&c28=0&c29=0&c30=0&c31=0&c32=0&c33=0&c34=0&c35=0&c36=0&c37=0&c38=0&c39=0&c40=0&c41=0&c42=0&c43=0&c44=0&c45=0&c46=0&c47=0&c48=0&c49=0&c50=0&c51=0&c52=0&c53=0&c54=0&c55=0&c56=0&c57=0&c58=0&c59=0&) We get a dark male face on a light background. If we slide it the other way, we get a light female face on a dark background. Here are the 3 faces: Eve, God and Adam as it were:

So the first dimension is represented as a line. The second dimension would be a plane, normally. If we move the 2nd slider back and forth we experience side lighting effects.

So we've filled the screen and we've only used 2 of our 60 dimensions. We need to do better.

To cut to the chase, our current, best representation manages to encode 12 dimensions of data before the GPU maxes out and our laptop heats to 220 degrees:

We're using three.js/WebGl for this....
