The 'Curse of Dimensionality' refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces. (Wikipedia) Visualizing higher dimensional spaces is a problem that recurs frequently in scientific and mathematic didactic settings and our explorations here with the Face Cloud have wider application in those domains.

It often seems easiest to start with the average face:
![Average face](../project_images/2014-03-02/average.jpg?raw=true)

Note how all the coordinates are 0. This face resides exactly in the middle of the face cloud.   

The average face is androgynous. It is not race-neutral because our original sample set (a commonly used research data set from academia) was biased towards caucasian faces. This is a problem we hope to fix in the future as we collect more faces. Research data sets are not always very diverse. 

What if we move the top slider to the right? Try it yourself here: [Average Face](http://facefield.org/SynthFace.aspx?c0=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&c5=0&c6=0&c7=0&c8=0&c9=0&c10=0&c11=0&c12=0&c13=0&c14=0&c15=0&c16=0&c17=0&c18=0&c19=0&c20=0&c21=0&c22=0&c23=0&c24=0&c25=0&c26=0&c27=0&c28=0&c29=0&c30=0&c31=0&c32=0&c33=0&c34=0&c35=0&c36=0&c37=0&c38=0&c39=0&c40=0&c41=0&c42=0&c43=0&c44=0&c45=0&c46=0&c47=0&c48=0&c49=0&c50=0&c51=0&c52=0&c53=0&c54=0&c55=0&c56=0&c57=0&c58=0&c59=0&) We get a dark male face on a light background. If we slide it the other way, we get a light female face on a dark background. Here are the 3 faces: Eve, God and Adam as it were:

![Average face](../project_images/2014-03-02/AdamAndEve.png?raw=true)

So the first dimension is represented as a line. The second dimension would be a plane, normally. If we move the 2nd slider back and forth we experience side lighting effects.

In this picture, Adam and Eve are to the right and left of the Average face. Left-lit and Right-lit faces are below and above. Then we further subdivide the space using smaller faces.

So we've filled the screen and we've only used 2 of our 60 dimensions. We need to do better. Of course we have a third dimension available as well. 

So to cut to the chase, We chose to work with the smaller fractal faces introduced into the picture above to push into higher dimensions.

This is getting complex and it seems like some sort of data-graphic needs to be introduced to grasp the visualization. Our current, best representation manages to encode 12 dimensions of data into 320 faces (below). With panning and zooming as well as roation, we are able to explore this space. It is not clear how we would push further as the higher dimensional faces are becoming quite small, and the GPU on the laptop is maxing out at a temperature well above 220 degrees!

Some outstanding issues:   
1. This is served in a browser using Three.js and WebGL, but is quite resource intensive.    
2. We need good ways to navigate the space, for now we just have it spin with panning and zooming.   
3. A diagram might help.
