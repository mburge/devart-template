Face Recognition and the Face Field   

It might be worth tracing the road we have followed to get to our current set of questions. As follows:   

The terms Face Detectoin and Face Recognition are often used interchangeably but to be precise, Face Detection picks out faces from an image, whereas Face Recognition takes a new image of a face and matches it with one it has previously seen. Our research has focuses on Face Recognition, in particular the Eigen Faces methodology as implemented in OpenCV.   

Eigenfaces analysis is a statistical face recognition technique. It uses Principal Component Analysis to calculate a set of Eigenvectors, or Eigenfaces. These Eigenfaces can be thought of as 'face ingredients'. To calibrate the model, we calculated 60 Eigenfaces on a training set of over one thousand faces. Thereafter, whenever a new face is uploaded, it is subjected to a subspace projection that reconstitutes it as a linear combination of these Eigenfaces. Normally at this point, a face recognition algorithm would look for the closest match in this 60-dimensional Eigenface space. We are not interested in surveillance technologies but in exploring this 60-dimensional field of faces images.   

Our training engine was written in C# and C++. We modified the OpenCV code to allow us to extract the raw subspace coordinates and store them in a database. We also wrote a routine to reconstitute a face from the coordinates which turned out later to be a very interesting vein of inquiry:   

```
Mat Eigenfaces::reconstructFromCoordinates(InputArray coordinates) const {   
    Mat projection = coordinates.getMat();   
    // slice the eigenvectors from the model   
    Mat evs = Mat(_eigenvectors, Range::all(), Range(0, _num_components));   
    Mat reconstruction = subspaceReconstruct(evs, _mean, projection);   
    return reconstruction.reshape(1,_faceRows);   
}   

```
