If you had 60 electronic brushes to paint a portrait, what could you create?

Our proto-type is up and running and allows you to do just that: http://facefield.org/SynthFace.aspx

We used Dat.Gui from [Chrome Experiments](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com) to enable the user to manipulate the 60 dimensions of the Face Cloud.

Try it out!

Animated Gif that shows some of the features (albeit with a reduced grey-scale palette due to the constraints of the gif technology):
